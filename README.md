# Fatigue-RCC-MRx

This library allows to assess fatigue lifetime of a component following RCC-MRx standards [1]. Two methodologies can be followed: Stress range or strain range calculation. Stress range is used when the FEM calculation for both initial and final state is elastic. When performing an elastoplastic calculation, strain range must be used.
